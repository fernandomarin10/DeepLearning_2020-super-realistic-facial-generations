In order to execute the code the files must be in a folder named "FP" and at its time this folder must be in the directory: /content/drive/My Drive/DeepLearning_2020/.

The input images will be taken from the "/DeepLearning_2020/FP/Data" folder and the output will be placed in "/DeepLearning_2020/FP/Results".

The animal faces experiment has been a fail like we mentioned in the oral presentation.

The folder "/DeepLearning_2020/FP/Results/testGifs" contains all the test outputs we have done so far.
