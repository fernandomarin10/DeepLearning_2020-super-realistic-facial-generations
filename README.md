# DeepLearning_2020-super-realistic-facial-generations
### Team: Fernando Mar√≠n - Marta Mir - Mateu Busquets
## Project structure
Data folder contains all the inputs and Results all the outputs.

The folder "/DeepLearning_2020/FP/Results/testGifs" contains all the test outputs we have done so far.

## Instrucctions
In order to execute the code the files must be in a folder named "FP" and at its time this folder must be in the directory: /content/drive/My Drive/DeepLearning_2020/.

To use the input data, create a Data folder in "/content/drive/My Drive/DeepLearning_2020/Data" and download the data from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vGmep59TujTZeubzXdAxlCxxTgGP0PJO?usp=sharing

The input images will be taken from the "/DeepLearning_2020/FP/Data" folder and the output will be placed in "/DeepLearning_2020/FP/Results".

## Extra comments

The animal faces experiment has been a fail like we mentioned in the oral presentation.
